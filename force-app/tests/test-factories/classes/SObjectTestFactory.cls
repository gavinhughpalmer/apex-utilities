 * @description This factory class is to be utilised within the tests of this package,
 *   the actual object it is creating is not important it is just when some kind of DML
 *   is needed in the test, as you can see below we have chosen to use the log object as
 *   this has no dependancies and has a low risk of failure to insert when being created.
