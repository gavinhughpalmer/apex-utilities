# BulkLogObjectAdapter class

The bulk log object adapter can be used to insert logs as a custom object into the database, as a singleton the write logs can be called at the end of a trigger to insert the full logs into the system only once per object The class has been adapted to use events so that it can still insert log objects when a transaction is rolled back, allowing it to be more robust in trigger contexts Usage: Logger log = LoggerFactory.createLogger(MyClass.class); log.warn('A warning message'); log.close();
